When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you wish to collaborate with other developers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes you don't want to have all commits. You want to have "clear" history, not a bunch of commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - when I want to clone repository from Github to my Github profile (for example if I don't have permission to change original repository...)
Clone - when I want to clone repository locally onto my computer
Branches - when I want to test/implement some feature or fix bug

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
In that case you have all possible changes made by other collaborators included. You know that you are working with latest code.
